* OOP model of phaser
* Screen follow cursor -- possible bug because when you move mouse, creep spawn is different
* Pool and Factory combined for Bullet And Unit which also extend Phaser.Group. (pretty cool stuff)
* Creeps walking on path and colliding with background(should implement A* algorithm for path finding)
* Towers shoot at most forward enemy(first, it is room for fix if enemies with different speed)
* Enemies take damage from bullets and give reward to player when dead
* Player object, that has gold and others, earns gold from creeps and towers cost money
* Move towers as cursor when click on button for build
* Tower to build over road or other tower turns red and can't be build
