* OOP model of phaser
* Screen follow cursor -- possible bug because when you move mouse, creep spawn is different
* Object factories
* Creeps walking on path and colliding with background(should implement A* algorithm for path finding)
* Player is able to build towers
* Towers shoot at most forward enemy(first, it is room for fix if enemies with different speed)
* Bullet pool, simple bullet and extending Phaser.Group
* Enemies take damage from bullets and give reward to player when dead
* Player object, that has gold and others, earns gold from creeps and towers cost money
